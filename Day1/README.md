Defining the internet:                                                                                                                                                  The internety is a web of connected computers all over the world which communicate with each other and exchange information and files which ultimately culminates providing us users with various things like internet relay chatting, accessing websites and much more. The computers are connected with either wired or wireless mediums.
Workings of a website:                                                                                                                                                 When you enter a link in the browser, it requests a DNS lookup, which correlates the link to the IP address of the website that we are looking for. That request is then sent to the server where it sends back the html, css and javascript of the entire webpage as a response. And finally, the webpage that we want appears in the our screens.
